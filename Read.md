**TP2 OMD USING UML**

This involves building a mini text editor offering the following concepts and functions:
- the text is contained in a buffer (work area),
- there is a notion of text selection, with user commands allowing
to move the start and end of the selection,
- copy the selection to the clipboard,
- copy the selection to the clipboard then delete the selection,
- replace ("paste") the selection with the contents of the clipboard,
- the human-machine interface is of any type (textual or graphical).
