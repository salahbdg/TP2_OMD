# **TP2 OMD USING UML**

This involves building a mini text editor offering the following concepts and functions:
- The text is contained in a buffer (work area),
- There is a notion of text selection, with user commands allowing to move the start and end of the selection,
- Copy the selection to the clipboard,
- Copy the selection to the clipboard then delete the selection,
- Replace ("paste") the selection with the contents of the clipboard,
- The human-machine interface is of any type (textual or graphical).


# How to use the mini text editor

- To cut we use : `ctrl+shift+X`
- To paste we use : `ctrl+shift+V`
- To undo : `ctrl+shift+Z`
